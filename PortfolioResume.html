			<img src = "Photos/Yellow Flower.png" alt ="This image shows a close-up of several bright yellow dandelion flowers. The flowers are in full bloom, displaying their characteristic dense cluster of narrow petals. The background is blurred out, emphasizing the sharp detail of the flower in the foreground. The dandelions are set against a natural backdrop of green grass, giving the image a vibrant, spring-like feel." title ="Golden Focus"  width= 250 height="auto" align="left" />
			
			<img src = "Photos/Walk_.png" alt ="A paved walking path stretches into the distance under a vivid sunset sky. Wooden railings line both sides, while bare trees stand silhouetted on the right. A small moon hangs above soft, glowing clouds. Street art decorates the path in the foreground, adding a creative touch to the peaceful scene." title ="Twilight Passage"  width="250" height= "auto" valign="middle" />
			<img src = "Photos/River.png" alt ="A wide, fast-moving river winds through a forest of bare trees under a moody, overcast sky. The water appears dark and slightly choppy, reflecting the gray tones of the clouds above. Early spring buds are just beginning to emerge on some branches, hinting at the changing season. The scene feels quiet and untouched, with a raw, natural atmosphere." title ="River Before the Rain"  width="250" height="auto" align ="right" />


			<img src = "Photos/Art Face.png" alt ="A weathered bronze sculpture of a mans face takes center stage, eyes closed and expression serene, as though caught in a moment of peaceful reflection. The surface bears textures and subtle green patina from age and exposure, enhancing its character. Around the head is a circular frame made of rusted, intertwined metal, adding a raw, organic contrast to the calm face. Soft sunlight highlights the contours and gives the sculpture warmth against a blurred backdrop of leafy green and yellow foliage. The mix of tranquility and ruggedness creates a powerful balance between peace and endurance." title ="Echoes of a Quiet Soul"  width="250" height="auto" align ="left" />
			<img src = "Photos/Sun.png" alt ="The image shows a peaceful outdoor scene during sunset. The sun is low in the sky, glowing brightly through a cluster of leafless trees, casting a warm golden light across the area. In the foreground, theres a quiet street bordered by patches of grass. Behind it stands a structure with concrete pillars and an elevated walkway, likely part of a campus or institutional building. To the right, a large building labeled William Beaumont Hall is partially visible. The trees some bare and others evergreen suggest its late fall or early winter. The overall mood is calm and reflective, with soft evening light and long shadows adding warmth to the cool setting." title ="Fading Day"  width="250" height="auto" valign ="middle" />
			<img src = "Photos/Duck.png" alt ="a calm, natural riverside landscape. A single goose grazes on lush green grass near the waters edge. The river flows smoothly, its surface rippling in gentle motion. Across the water, a stretch of rocky shore leads to a dense wall of trees, rich with shades of green and touches of early autumn yellow. Soft sunlight casts a warm glow over the scene, creating a peaceful sense of stillness and harmony in nature." title ="Grace Beside the Flow"  width="250" height="auto" align ="right" />
